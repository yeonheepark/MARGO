### README  

The file **run.R** provides an example implementation of the proposed design for **Scenario 7** in the manuscript.  

### **Output Explanation**  

In your output, you will find multiple rows indicating the machine learning (ML) method used for adaptive randomization:  

- **ML = "SVM"**: Implements the Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
- **ML = "KNN"**: Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.  
- **ML = "RF"**: Implements the Random Forest (RF) algorithm.  
- **ML = "NN"**: Implements the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).  

One of these machine learning methods is utilized to perform adaptive randomization throughout the trial.
